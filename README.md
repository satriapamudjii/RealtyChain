This repository hosts a Python Flask server designed to augment a decentralized real estate management platform that utilizes blockchain for property listings, secure transactions, and transparent recordkeeping. The server focuses on handling API requests unrelated to blockchain transactions. It is tasked with fetching additional property data from external real estate APIs and conducting complex analytics on property information. This additional layer of data enrichment and analysis provides comprehensive insights and enhances the functionality of the blockchain-based platform, offering users a more robust real estate management tool.
